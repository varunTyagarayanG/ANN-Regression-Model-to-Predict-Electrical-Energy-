# Artificial Neural Network

Designed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to forecast the electrical energy output of a power plant based on various input parameters. 
Conducted data preprocessing, normalization, and feature selection. Trained and evaluated the model using mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE).
